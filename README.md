# Google for MATLAB

Google for MATLAB allows you to quickly access Google from the Command Window of MATLAB.

Whether you are searching for the perfect carbonara recipe or some useful advice on how to survive your doctoral studies, this simple function can save you some clicks and open Google in your default browser.

From the Command Window just type:

```matlab
google How to survive your PhD
```

or

```Matlab
google How to cook the perfect carbonara
```
and your default browser will pop up with the results of the search.

### I'm Feeling Lucky :four_leaf_clover:
You can use the "I'm Feeling Lucky" option as well. At the end of your query just append `-l` or `--lucky`:

```matlab
google github -l
google matlab --lucky
```

### Installation :floppy_disk:
Just clone (or fork) this repo and add it to the PATH on MATLAB.
